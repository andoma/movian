Improve metadata lookup

User is now able to enter a custom query in the
item popup menu. It's also possible to enter a
IMDb ID directly there.

Showtime will also automatically use the folder name
of the video if it seems more appropriate. An internal
scoring system is used to choose if it should try
to search using file name or folder name.

Score results can be seen as debug in logfile
