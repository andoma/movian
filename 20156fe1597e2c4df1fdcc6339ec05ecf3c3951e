ps3: Rework button handling a bit on the six axis controller

* Select + Directional buttons will move items (when possible)
  Currently this can be done on the home screen

* Select + Triangle will switch view (if possible)
  Not many pages comes with multiple views at the moment

* Pressing harder on the buttons will increase the repeat rate, thus
  Pressing harder -> Scrolling faster (our work is never over)
