Add built-in FTP server

FTP server is default disabled but can be enabled in
Settings -> Network settings

To add directories in the FTP server root you need to have a bookmark
for the directory and set the new 'Published in Virtual File System'
setting to true for each bookmark you want to have in the FTP server.

The FTP server is still very much beta so feedback will be appreciated
