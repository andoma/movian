Add support for auto detection of character encoding

For some subtitle files (downloaded or locally stored) which
is not UTF-8 encoded Showtime used to decode the file using
the 'SRT character set' setting in Settings -> Languages.

This has now changed a bit.

The 'SRT character set' setting has been renamed to 'Default character set'
as the setting does not only influense SRT files but also SUB files and
a few other things where the character encoding is not explicitly set.

On top of that the setting now defaults to 'Auto' which means that
Showtime tries to guess the encoding based on an algorithm.
Some initial tests shows that it's able to guess right most of the
times for subtitle files.

If it should do the wrong guess the user is always free to configure
the 'Default character set' to something else than Auto
