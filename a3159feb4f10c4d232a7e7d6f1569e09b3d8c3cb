PS3: Use jemalloc instead of newlib's malloc

Using jemalloc significantly reduces memory fragmentation
and thus mitigates the out of memory conditions that happens
now and then when using Showitme (in particular during movie
playback)

It's also much more efficient than newlib's malloc thanks
to per-thread caching of allocation and per-thread memory
arenas
