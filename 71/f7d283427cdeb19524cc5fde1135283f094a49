Store per-file settings in filesystem (instead of database)

Showtime will now store settings for each file and folder (such as
selected subtitle track, video zoom, folder sorting, etc, etc)
in the filesystem. The information is stored using Extended
Attributes. Currenetly this is supported for SMB (Windows shares)
only.

The upside here is that if you have multiple Showtime installations
accessing the same windows share they will now share the settings
between them. So you can start watching a movie on one machine
and then just continue where you left off on another machine.

Also, the settings will stick to the file even if it's moved
on the server.

This is default on (but can be turned off in Settings -> General)
