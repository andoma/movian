Initial attempt of a built-in FTP client in Showtime

To use it enter 'ftp://ip.address.of.ftpserver' in search bar
or create a bookmark (much like the CIFS/SMB client)

Note that the code has only been tested against a few FTP servers
so it's probably still buggy. If you find any problems and want
to report please turn on "FTP logging" in settings:dev and include
the logfile in ticket.
