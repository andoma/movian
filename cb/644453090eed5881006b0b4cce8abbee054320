Work on metadata lookup for movies.

Allow the user to select the 'none' datasource that will just not try to
lookup anything for a given file

Improve logic that use foldername to search for movie metadata. Showtime
will now use the folder name if there is no match when using title to search
and only if there is only one video file longer than 5 minutes in the folder.

Get rid of various crashes related to metadata probing
