Correct subtitle cordinates if subs displays outside of visible screen

For subtitles that specifies absolute coordinatese (PGS, etc) Showtime
now checks if the subtitle image fits on screen. If the subtitle
does not fit it tries to position the subtitle first using 1280x720
resolution. If it does not fit there either it retries with 1920x1080.

Fixes #1051
