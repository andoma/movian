Improved support for opensubtitles.org

Showtime will now search in opensubtitles.org database using the
movie title and optionally the IMDB ID if it manages to resolve that

To limit the number of returned results it will only include the
subtitles that matches the languages configured in Settings -> Languages.
If no such configuration has been entered all results will be displayed.
