upnp: Use URL to video file as canonical URL

Since we no longer need canonicalUrl in order to do continuous play we
are much better of keeping the object ID away from it.

One upside is that Showtime now recognizes the same move in terms of
'seen', playcount, etc even if viewed from different folders on a UPNP server.
Tested with Twonky and MiniDLNA

Fixes #1788 (I hope)
