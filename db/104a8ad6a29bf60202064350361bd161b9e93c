Add support for reading splitted files transparently

For local file systems (such as internal HD, connected USB drives, etc)
Showtime can now automatically concat files named foo.001, foo.002, ...
into one file.

Some tools that can do these types of splits
FFSJ, HJ-Split, WinSplit, MasterSplitter...

Note that this is not the same thing as splitting a file with MKV tools

Fixes #1193
